# RC Car Project
The goal of this project is to create an RC Car from scratch
The materials provided for the project are:
Arduino UNO 3,
DC Motors,
Servo,
LIPO Battery,
RC Controller and Receiver,
and Wire.

The rest of the parts either need to be 3d printed, laser-cut, or machined

This git is for all of the files to control the car via rc controller and the electrical diagram (made in fritizing, .fz file also available). All code is written in C++ in order to support arduino use.
